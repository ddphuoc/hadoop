This guideline is step by step to install Hadoop version 3.3.0
Source: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-hadoop-ubuntu

1. Login Ubuntu with user hadoop: su - hdoop

2. Download Hadoop installation: wget https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.0/hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz

3. Once the download is complete, extract the files to initiate the Hadoop installation (install command tar if it not available using apt): tar xzf hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz

Single Node Hadoop Deployment (Pseudo-Distributed Mode)
Hadoop excels when deployed in a fully distributed mode on a large cluster of networked servers. However, if you are new to Hadoop and want to explore basic commands or test applications, you can configure Hadoop on a single node. This setup, also called pseudo-distributed mode, allows each Hadoop daemon to run as a single Java process. A Hadoop environment is configured by editing a set of configuration files:
    bashrc
    hadoop-env.sh
    core-site.xml
    hdfs-site.xml
    mapred-site-xml
    yarn-site.xml
    
4. Edit the .bashrc shell configuration file using a text editor of your choice (we will be using nano): nano .bashrc

Define the Hadoop environment variables by adding the following content to the end of the file:
#Hadoop Related Options
export HADOOP_HOME=/home/hdoop/hadoop-3.3.0
export HADOOP_INSTALL=$HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_HDFS_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME
export YARN_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME
export HADOOP_COMMON_LIB_NATIVE_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/lib/native
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin:$HADOOP_HOME/bin
export HADOOP_OPTS"-Djava.library.path=$HADOOP_HOME/lib/nativ"

5. It is vital to apply the changes to the current running environment by using the following command: source ~/.bashrc
